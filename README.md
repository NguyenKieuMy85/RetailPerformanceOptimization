# RetailPerformanceOptimization
This project showcases a complete Business Intelligence and Data Mining solution applied to a retail supply chain dataset. The goal is to optimize sales performance, understand return behaviors, and support decision-making through data-driven insights.

üîç Project Overview
We designed an end-to-end BI pipeline, including:

ETL processing with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

Data modeling with star schema and OLAP cube using SSAS

Interactive reporting via Power BI and MDX queries

Predictive modeling with Random Forest and CNN to forecast product returns

This project helps retail businesses uncover hidden patterns, reduce return rates, and improve customer satisfaction through actionable insights.
